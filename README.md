# Magic-8-Ball
Ask a question, receive an answer.  

Created with resources from Skillcrush Frontend Developer Blueprint.  

Define list of answers the user can receive. When user clicks on the ask button, they are prompted to type in a yes/no question. A random answer is selected and displayed for the user. Ball shakes upon user hitting enter after asking question, answer fades in. If user clicks to ask another question, the previous answer is removed.  


To-dos:
* Fix question prompt, user is prompted twice without seeing answer?
* Graphics, CSS, make it look better on the page and better adjust to changing screen sizes 
* Sound effects?
